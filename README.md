We have a lot of podcasts apps available nowadays on the Web, but some of them do not care about UI, UX, and performance at all. After noticing it, the idea to create a podcast app that's accessible has a nice UI/UX and an acceptable performance came in mind. 

Podhouse is a web podcast app created having in mind a nice and clean UI/UX and performance for the users. Bringing the best from a few different apps, Podhouse is intended to be the clearest and best experience for you to listen to your favorite podcasts.
